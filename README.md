# Modern Binary Exploitation (MBE) Course Notes

This repository contains all the Exploit code I wrote while taking the [Modern Binary Exploitation](https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE) course by `RPISEC`. In addition to all Exploit code, I have decided to share my notes taken during each challenge. I hope this gives back to the community and inspires others to engage in the Art of Exploitation. I also want to redirect your attention to a new course released by `RET2 SYSTEMS` known as [**WarGames**](https://wargames.ret2.systems/). This course focuses on the x64 architecture and is completely hosted online, whereas MBE is locally hosted and geared towards the x86 architecture. The challenges within `WarGames` are written by experts who have not only discovered 0days but publicly disclosed them in competitions such as Pwn2Own. I'm a firm believer that both courses have immense value and as a testament to that I can state that around the time I completed MBE I was able to find a 0day in Broadcom products having never touched the x64 architecture. With all that said, I hope I can aid you on your journey into the world of Exploit Development. 

Please keep in mind my notes were written by a younger me, so the grammar is not up to par to my current standards. However, I figured I would do minimal modifications to the document to get it out as soon as possible. Special thanks to [SirPanOfTheCake](https://github.com/SirPanOfTheCake) and [Benjamin Zawadzki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-zawadzki-8260a3176) for helping me skim through this real quick. Kudos to [SneakyNachos](https://github.com/SneakyNachos) for introducing me to MBE, [Alfredo Pesoli](https://twitter.com/__rev) for helping me write my first real Linux Kernel Exploit and hearing my mad ramblings during RET2, and [REDACTED]() for pushing me to continue in the Art of Exploit Development. I also want to give a shoutout to my boss [Johnny Sprada](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnnysprada/) for supporting my team in pursuing Binary Exploitation and seeing the value it provides our Red Team.

Finally I want to thank the creators of Modern Binary Exploitation (MBE) for open sourcing the course to begin with!
